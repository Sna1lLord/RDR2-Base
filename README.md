# Welcome!
- This is an internal base for the game Red Dead Redemption 2
- It uses a bunch of libraries created by me (some of which are available for download on my github repositories)
- For example, it has a very fast signature scanner
- Please leave a ‚≠ê if you found it interesting!
- At 30 stars I am releasing a base for cs2, and after that one a base for GTAV

# Usage
- Usage of the base requires some steps
- It ueses CMake, so you'll have to install that if you haven't already
- https://cmake.org/download/
- I recommend using visual studio code for the project since that is what I created it in
- Installation from CMD ***(important)***:
1. git clone https://github.com/Sna1lLord/RDR2-Base.git --recurse-submodules
- Now you should be able to open the folder installed with visual studio code and run "CMake: Configure" followed by "CMake: Build"

# Issues
- Be sure to contact me if you encounter any issues (which you probably will)

# Disclaimer
- I do **NOT** advice using this cheat in the online mode of Red Dead Redemption 2
- For several reasons, it's not a good idea to try using this in online mode, although you could
- I do not know the detection status of the cheat, neither have I used any time to look into it
- The UI was whipped up very fast and I did not spend much time on it
- This is **NOT** a complete cheat, and only a base which you can build your *own* cheat on
