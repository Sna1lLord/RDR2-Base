# Welcome!
- This is an internal base for the game Red Dead Redemption 2
- It uses a bunch of libraries created by me (some of which are available for download on my github repositories)
- For example, it has a very fast signature scanner
- Please leave a ‚≠ê if you found it interesting!
- At 30 stars I am releasing a base for cs2, and after that one of GTAV

# Usage
- Usage of the base requires some steps
- It ueses CMake, so you'll have to install that if you haven't already
- https://cmake.org/download/
- I recommend using visual studio code for the project since that is what I created it in
